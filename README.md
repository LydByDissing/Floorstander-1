# Floorstander-1

The goal are to create a floorstanding speaker with this project - still very much WIP.

## Design Goals

1. F3 should reach into the 30-40Hz range
2. Cabinet should be "as low as possible" - right now I am going for about 600mm
3. Tweeter and midrange should be a point source - i.e. so either a COAX or full range driver, or a planar

# Cabinet Design

At the moment I am looking into applying a mass loaded transmission line cabinet, as this, at least in theory, should let us play low and loud with relatively small drivers
